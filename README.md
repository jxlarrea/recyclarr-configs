A set of [Recyclarr](https://github.com/recyclarr/recyclarr) configuration files for maximum quality 4K/HDR and 1080p downloads. Based on the [domalab/recyclarr-config](https://github.com/domalab/recyclarr-config) repository and heavily modified to fit my needs.

The focus of this configuration is to always grab the highest quality releases with separate profiles for 4K/HDR/DV, 4K/SDR and 1080p. Uncompressed audio formats (TrueHD and DTS-MA) are also preferred. 

It also imports every single Custom Format from [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info/) (with a few of exceptions) even if some of those aren't assigned to any profiles.
